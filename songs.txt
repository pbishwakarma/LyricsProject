'Break You Down' by Kamaiyah


You keep saying you don't want me
But your actions screaming loud
Bet you gon' put me when nobody is around
I can break you down, break you down, break you down
Can break you down, break break, break you down
I can break you down, break you down, break you down
Can break you down, break break, break you down


You need a girl that treats you right
You need a girl that freaks you right
In the morning, in the evening
That could freak you through the night
Though I keep it tight, I say "Hell. yeah"
Bump and grind, I say "Hell, yeah"
Work your mind, get you open wide
Won't be satisfied, can't go elsewhere
We'll be making love like it's going out of style
Freak you on the bed, on the floor and the couch
Can see it in your eyes that when nobody is around
You gon' put it down


You keep saying you don't want me
But your actions screaming loud
Bet you gon' put me when nobody is around
I can break you down, break you down, break you down
Can break you down, break break, break you down
I can break you down, break you down, break you down
Can break you down, break break, break you down


Can you satisfy my appetite?
When I get it up, can you put it down, let me act it right?
Don't be acting shy, go 'head and relax your mind
Cause I'm a freak like you and it's maximized
We can freak it, boy, we can freak it
And we ain't gotta tell no one, it's our secret
And I can see it in your eyes that you really want me
And you gon' put it on me


You keep saying you don't want me
But your actions screaming loud
Bet you gon' put me when nobody is around
I can break you down, break you down, break you down
Can break you down, break break, break you down
I can break you down, break you down, break you down
Can break you down, break break, break you down


You keep saying you don't want me
But your actions screaming loud
Bet you gon' put me when nobody is around
I can break you down, break you down, break you down
Can break you down, break break, break you down
I can break you down, break you down, break you down
Can break you down, break break, break you down

'Drowning' by A Boogie wit da Hoodie


I'm drownin'
I'm drownin'
I'm drownin'
I'm drownin'


Wrist so icy, wonder why she like me, bitch I'm drownin'
In water, I just bought a Cuban, dipped it in a fountain
Everywhere that I go it's a light show, I'm surrounded
Bust down, bust down, bust down, bust down, bust down, bitch I'm drownin'
I just bought a Cuban ring and dipped it in a fountain
Chain so heavy I feel like I'm holdin' up a mountain
Everywhere that I go it's a light show, I'm surrounded
Bust down, bust down, bust down, bust down, bust down, bitch I'm drownin'


I'm with all my niggas, I don't go nowhere without 'em
If they don't let us in they might throw shots at the bouncer
Actavis medicine, got it straight from out the doctor's
I'm with RJ but I call him Wayne 'cause he's a shotta
Pick up the ladder, put it in the gun, make the 9 stretch
Niggas with attitude, but we come straight out of Highbridge
I'm gon' make her panties wet when she see the way I flex
I'm gon' win a Grammy, move my family out the projects
We went from chillin' in the projects to makin' projects
We was tryna get to the top, and they tried to stop us
I talk for myself, bitch I don't need no fucking voucher
She looked at my wrist and she looked at a hundred thousand


Wrist so icy, wonder why she like me, bitch I'm drownin'
In water, I just bought a Cuban, dipped it in a fountain
Every where that I go it's a light show, I'm surrounded
Bust down, bust down, bust down, bust down, bust down, bitch I'm drownin'
I just bought a Cuban ring and dipped it in a fountain
Chain so heavy I feel like I'm holdin' up a mountain
Everywhere that I go it's a light show, I'm surrounded
Bust down, bust down, bust down, bust down, bust down, bitch I'm drownin'


Just bought a brand new chain from Avianne
Nigga with attitude but I ain't from Compton
Lil Kodak, bitch, I'm Polo'd down like Carlton
Sniper Gang I put a nigga on a carton
I'm the shit I'm fartin', I don't know how to potty
Pull up in a 'Rari, I'm in the Yo like Gotti
A Boogie, I'm goin Scottie, nigga drop my deposit
I ain't Jamaican, bitch I'm Haitian, but I got them shottas
Harley Davidson every day, I'm ridin' with the chopper
They hatin', I know they don't wanna see a nigga prosper
I ain't doing trims, I'm in the cut like I'm a barber
She call me daddy, but I ain't her motherfucking father


Wrist so icy, wonder why she like me, bitch I'm drownin'
In water, I just bought a Cuban, dipped it in a fountain
Every where that I go it's a light show, I'm surrounded
Bust down, bust down, bust down, bust down, bust down, bitch I'm drownin'
I just bought a Cuban ring and dipped it in a fountain
Chain so heavy I feel like I'm holdin' up a mountain
Everywhere that I go it's a light show, I'm surrounded
Bust down, bust down, bust down, bust down, bust down, bitch I'm drownin'


Bitch, I'm drownin'

Ridin' through the city, I ain't know that she was with it
She was tryna get with me so I had to get busy
See I met her at the Lenox, she was tryna buy some Jimmy's
And that ass like Serena like she had to play tennis, ayy
Swervin' on corner like skrrt 
She said, "Can I text you?" I'm like sure 
And I got on Gucci like burr
Shawty you gon' have to shave the fur 
And I might come ballin' like I'm Stephen Curry
Space Jam, Bill Murray, Munchies, Oreo McFlurry, whoa
I can't even lie, shawty thick and she purty
Work at the Blue Flame she doin' tricks up on that pole
I ain't even know that's your girlfriend
I'ma pass her like I'm Kyrie Irving
I'ma just take trips to Berlin
Why you tryna flex like you a virgin?


I just took a flick with your girlfriend

We not the same, Louis V frame
Look where I came, from Marta trains
Look at my game, I'm like King James
I'm making movies, just like the Wayans
Fuck what she sayin', she want a ring
Pimpin' ain't easy, Big Daddy Kane
Baby Ion't even know yo name
Hundred on the dash like I'm Dame
She wanna take trips to Romane
Call me David, I'm the one to blame
I can't even do it, babe, sorry, I can't even lie
Why you tryna fuck with me babe? You got another guy
She said, "Can I come again?" Maybe, girl, another time
Tramp stamp on her back, what is that a butterfly?
Blowin' on the gas from the Amoco
I just hit yo girl in my Polo Pajamas tho
Gotta stay strapped like I'm Rambo tho
And she thick and she pretty  like Amber Rose


I just took a flick with your girlfriend

'iSpy' by Kyle


Man, fuck

Man, these kids, man, talkin' shit, makin' me feel bad
Man, fuck them kids, bro! Look around, bro, look at life
Man, you're right

You damn right I'm right, I can't remember a time I was god-damn wrong
Man, thanks, Lil' Boat
Hey man, that's what I'm here for


I ain't been gettin' high...
Well maybe a little, baby, I don't wanna lie
I know when you text me, girl, I don't always reply
Well you're not an angel either, you can't even fly
I notice, you think that you know shit
All this shade that's comin' at me, I wonder who throws it
They can't see the vision, boy they must be out of focus
That's a real hot album homie, I wonder who wrote it, oh shit
Otay, pray them niggas go away
Always hella clowns around it look like Cirque Du Soleil
This is not the album either, these are just the throwaways
This shit still so cold when it drop, it's gonna be a mothafuckin' snow day
Ayy, boy is good and he knows it, he don't say it, he shows it
I'm just like DeRozan, if I shoot it, it goes in
I am in Cali just coastin', get 'em so wet they need coasters
I got a selfie with Oprah, I just ain't never post it
And I'm in my happy place posted, I ain't frown since '06
I ain't cried since '01, my pad like Six Flags and your house is no fun
You can come back to mine though, your friend ain't cute but it's fine though
We gon' end on a high note


I spy with my little eye
A girlie I can get 'cause she don't get too many likes
A curly-headed cutie I can turn into my wife
Wait, that means forever, ever, hold up, never mind
Oh, I spy with my little eye
A girlie I can get 'cause she don't get too many likes
A curly-headed cutie I can turn into my wife
Wait, that means forever, ever, hold up, never mind


Oh I, I spy with my little eye
I spy, I spy with my little eye
Oh I, I spy with my little eye
I spy, I spy with my little eye
Oh I...


She said she 21, I might have to I.D. that
All my bitches come in pairs like balls in my nutsack
I remember ridin' around the city in a Hatchback
Lookin' for a problem with my young goblins
I'ma send a model home with her neck throbbin'
I done made so much money that it's non-stoppin'
Got my brothers on my back like the last name
I remember tellin' everyone I couldn't be tamed
Woah, six months later I had snapped and now I'm in the game
Went from fake chains to diamonds in another lane
Went from "Can you take me here?" to screening out the lane
Went from "Damn this nigga lame" to remember my name
So I remember all the people who ain't fucked with me
They went to college, now all them niggas is history
Upgraded from gold to diamonds in my teeth
Riding deep in the van, like we lookin' for a mystery 
So don't fuck with me
No, lately I been livin' like luxury
Boat and Kyle stick together like piano keys
And on my mother's mother I won't fuck a bitch without a damn rubber


I spy with my little eye
A girlie I can get 'cause she don't get too many likes
A curly-headed cutie I can turn into my wife
Wait, that means forever, ever, hold up, never mind
Oh, I...I spy with my little eye
A girlie I can get 'cause she don't get too many likes
A curly-headed cutie I can turn into my wife
Wait, that means forever, ever, hold up, never mind


Oh I, I spy with my little eye
I spy, I spy with my little eye
Oh I, I spy with my little eye
I spy, I spy with my little eye
Oh I...
